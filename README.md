# Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Model for Song Lyrics Generation

Welcome to the Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Model project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a fine-tuned version of the GPT-2 model, specifically designed to generate song lyrics. By leveraging a collection of lyrics from various American singers, this model can produce creative and coherent song lyrics based on user-provided prompts.

## Overview

The GPT-2 model, developed by OpenAI, is a state-of-the-art language model that has been widely used for various natural language processing tasks. In this project, we have fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on a dataset of American singers' song lyrics. The training process involved preprocessing the lyrics, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The result is a model capable of generating unique and contextually relevant lyrics.

## Training Process

The model was trained using a dataset that includes a diverse range of song lyrics from popular American artists. The training process involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The lyrics were tokenized and converted into a format suitable for training the model.
2.  **Model Training**: The GPT-2 model was fine-tuned on the tokenized lyrics using a training loop that optimized the model's parameters.
3.  **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated on a validation set to ensure its ability to generate high-quality lyrics.

## How to Use the Model

To use the fine-tuned GPT-2 model, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the [`lyrical-gpt2.ipynb`](lyrical-gpt2.ipynb) file.
4.  **Generate Lyrics**: In the notebook, you can input a prompt for the song lyrics you want to generate. The model will produce a continuation based on your input.

### Example Usage

In the notebook, you will find a function called [`generate_lyrics`](lyrical-gpt2.ipynb) that takes a prompt and generates lyrics. Simply call this function with your desired prompt to see the model in action.

## Demonstration

To showcase the capabilities of the fine-tuned model, we have included a demonstration video. You can view the video below to see how the model generates lyrics based on different prompts using the [`lyrical-gpt2.ipynb`](lyrical-gpt2.ipynb) notebook.
